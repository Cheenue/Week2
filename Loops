//Pick a Loop:
//Write a loop (any type of loop will work) that does a countdown from the variable countDown.
//
//Implement the following:
//- countDown is an already declared variable representing a user entered number.
//- Check to make sure the number is not larger than 10, but greater than or equal to 3.
//- Each time the loop runs, print the value of the counter followed by three periods (â€¦)
//- Once out of the loop, print "We have lift off!".
//- Use System.out.println() to print everything to the console.
//Note: If the user entered number is less than 3 or greater than 10, then the only message printed to the console is "We have lift off!"
