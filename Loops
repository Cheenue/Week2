Question 1

import java.util.Scanner;

//Pick a Loop:
//Write a loop (any type of loop will work) that does a countdown from the variable countDown.
//
//Implement the following:
//- countDown is an already declared variable representing a user entered number.
//- Check to make sure the number is not larger than 10, but greater than or equal to 3.
//- Each time the loop runs, print the value of the counter followed by three periods (â€¦)
//- Once out of the loop, print "We have lift off!".
//- Use System.out.println() to print everything to the console.
//Note: If the user entered number is less than 3 or greater than 10, then the only message printed to the console is "We have lift off!"

            // Write your code below this line

            if (countDown >= 3 && countDown <= 10) {
                System.out.println("We have lift off!");
            }


Question 2

While Loop Practice:
Create an if/else statement that checks to see if userNumber is more than 10 and under 100.
If so, execute a while loop that does the following:
- prints the value of userNumber
- decrements by 1 until userNumber is less than 10.
If not, print (exactly) "Your number is not between 10 and 100." to the console, including the "." at the end.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int userNumber;
		userNumber = in.nextInt();

        // Write your code below 
        
        if (userNumber > 10 && userNumber < 100) {
            while (userNumber >= 10){
                userNumber--;
            }
        }
        
        
	}
}
